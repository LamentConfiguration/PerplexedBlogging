<p>--Finally getting a break, and a chance to post something. A few updates on coding things that have happened since I last posted.</p>

<p>Firstly, I've switched to Atom over spacemacs, this is due to the fact that over the course of a week working with spacemacs that I am not nearly as comfortable configuring an Emacs environment, as I am configuring Atom. I've found that for my actual editing, I like to keep my hands on the keyboard, but for configuring, changing settings, and things like that, I prefer a mouse to work with things. Atom allows me to do this, also, with a few plugins, I can make Atom behave modally (like vim). As I have mentioned before, Atom has a strong and growing community supporting it, and the ecosystem of plugins and themes seems to be getting better by the day. No hate towards Emacs, I just can't get comfortable with everything (I'd say "again," but I always found myself a bit lost in Emacs).</p>

<p>Secondly, I've completely come to grips with the fact that I'm not ever going to be a "one-language" guy, but that different languages appeal to different parts of my personality.</p>

<p>Haskell, is, and always will be something I dabble in, explore, and learn. Working with it (for me) is like writing with my dip pens, the result is beautiful, elegant, and quite rewarding, but it takes a lot of time and patience. I will not be giving up on my pursuit of learning Haskell fluently, or using it for development once I do, but I have realized that I need to approach Haskell slowly and patiently in order for things to properly cement themselves.</p>

<p>So where does this leave me? I've looked harder at Rust (<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">https://www.rust-lang.org/</a>), and I like its design goals, as well as how it implements things. Yes, it is still quite a new and developing language, but to me, that is part of the allure and enjoyment of working with it. More on Rust in the future. (:</p>

<p>I had originally planned to use the JVM for all of my cross-platform development in the near future, but this is not the best solution for most of my goals, it is very possible, but it is not as efficient as I had hoped. So I unleashed my search-engine-fu (not only constrained to google), and found something quite interesting. I found Haxe (<a href="http://haxe.org/">http://haxe.org/</a>). Haxe is a toolkit (that includes it's own language) for developing and implementing frameworks that enable cross-platform development (<a href="http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/compiler-targets.html">http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/compiler-targets.html</a>). There are many libraries and frameworks already available (<a href="http://haxe.org/use-cases/">http://haxe.org/use-cases/</a>) targeting specific kinds of applications. I feel like (for now at least) Haxe will allow me to quickly prototype and deploy smaller apps across multiple platforms without creating a gigantic codebase.</p>

<p>Does this mean I'm giving up on the JVM? Nope! It has been relegated to something relatively esoteric: Polyglot Programming (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_%28computing%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_%28computing%29</a>). My interest in this started when I learned that Clojure can call Java directly, which upon further research lead to the knowledge that all of the languages targeting the JVM can work this way with each other. While I will not be dedicating too much time to this. I do have full intentions of seeing what can be done when combining various languages that target the JVM (mostly Frege, Clojure, Scala, and Ceylon, but there are so many choices!). This could be a very interesting way to combat horribly contrived syntax in one language, by implementing the function/feature in another.</p>

<p>That's all for now, I do have some rough posts and outlines coming together, I hope to get a couple more out soon!</p>
