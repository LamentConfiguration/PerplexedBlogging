<p>This too made me chuckle about vim: <br>

<p>Definitely been using Hy to prototype for Python, the advantage being that I can use names and such that will translate to Python, but structure things with LISP structures, which come a lot more naturally for me than anything else. Sure I sometimes end up having to really write some not-so-pretty code to make the translation happen, but I have been learning a lot about making things work in Python this way, while still getting to use and enjoy a LISP. Definitely a win-win right now (:</p>

<p>On a side note, I know the title of my blog might not seem quite as appropriate given that I'm mostly working in Python/C/Rust these days, which all allow functional programming to some extent, but don't require or enforce it. I <em>still</em> try to abide by functional paradigms, and keep as much of my data immutable, and my functions pure. I don't fret over side effects, and I don't spend hours trying to find a side-effect way to do something that I already know how to do that involves side effects. They are an unavoidable part of programming, and even Haskell has found a way to deal with them it its own mathematically magical way.</p>

<p>It is really a lot of fun trying to work things out, and I am enjoying the complete "power level" access I have using Python with either Rust or C libraries to get as close to the metal as I ever see myself needing to get. C is my go-to right now for that stuff, but I am keeping a close watch on Rust and learning it is small bites here and there. I'm also using Haskell as a break and distraction from the more work-related things I'm coding in Python. It is really nice to go from a "designed for day-to-day stuff" language, that makes some compromises in power/safety in order to facilitate rapid development, to a language that builds everything around a simple but powerful base construct (the typed lambda calculus), and develops things of incredible power and flexibility that sometimes take a while to properly digest, understand, and apply, but when they do click, it is quite an exciting revelation.</p>

<p>Oh, and this video of a Slayer song is absolutely fantastic: <br>
