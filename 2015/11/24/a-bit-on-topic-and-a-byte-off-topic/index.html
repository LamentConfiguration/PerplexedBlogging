<p>Ahhh, the holidays... such a wonderful time to have to deal with the general public &gt;.&lt;</p>

<p>... No, I'm not going to stray that far off topic, in fact, let's just start off "on" topic shall we?</p>

<p>I have gained an <em>immense</em> level of respect for the HTML/CSS and JavaScript combination over the last few days. Mostly through quickly brushing up on them as individual entities, their combined power has made sense to me.</p>

<p>Firstly, let me get out of the way, that this "web-tech" stack, is not flawless, it does have its compromises, and it is in no way perfect. However, it <strong>is</strong> extremely flexible and adaptable. The targetable platforms are: "Just about anything that can run a modern browser." This ability, to have <em>one</em> codebase for something that can reach out to a HUGE amount of people, is pretty sweet indeed. This webstack(HTML/CSS/JavaScript) <em>is</em> what frameworks for other languages (like Kivy for Python) are trying to create, but Kivy (for example) tries to keep it as "Python" as possible (which has some upsides (same language across all files) and downsides (integrating with different APIs). This isn't to say that the Kivy way is "wrong" it is just different. Being closer to the metal, a framework like Kivy will have some performance advantages for more demanding things, yes, but again, it will require hand-tweaked code for optimization across different platforms (although, if you aren't expecting this, you haven't looked into crosss-platform coding...).</p>

<p>The webstack does add another layer (the browser) between the program and the metal, but the technologies being developed for browsers are nothing short of incredible at this point. The "Browser" is quickly becoming a container for all sorts of capabilities on the web. Hell, WebGL allows webpages to directly access the GPU now. No, we won't be seeing an engine to kill UE4/Crysis/etc. in the browser any time soon (I will gladly be wrong about that too...), but the content of webapps/webpages just took a huge leap forward. These browser developments are also what inspired the creation of tools to be able to utilize the webstack on the desktop. In a way, if you look at it. The browser itself becomes the "framework" for the application (a perfect example of leveraging technology that already works well to one's advantage).</p>

<p>Now, on to the fact that this is a "stack" and not a singular language. Yes, they are different, arguably completely different... but <em>this is ok!</em> Hell, for me, this is more than "ok" it is freakin awesome! Realistically, they all serve a different purpose, and this makes it a lot easier for me to visualize how each part of the project will come together, and it also allows for easier task division on a project. As long as everyone adheres to the same standards in the project, most (if not everything) should just be able to "come together" in the end. In this environment, HTML is used to "lay out" the user experience, to position elements, and serve as the go-between for the program and user. CSS is used to give much more flexibility when it comes to the actual appearance of the HTML, think of the HTML as the building itself (walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, window frames, etc.), and the CSS as the decorations (wallpaper, carpet, light fixutres, doors, windows/curtains, etc.). In this context, you wouldn't hire an interior decorator to design your house, or an architect to coordinate your drapes with your furniture (would you? I know I wouldn't...).</p>

<p>While they are different aspects of the design, HTML and CSS are both design languages (primarily, HTML does have some tricks up its sleeve, but it is still a markup/rendering language at heart), and this is what brings us to JavaScript, the "engine" behind the webapp. JavaScript has a very humble beginning as a scripting language, created to add some functionality to webpages. It was designed to be easy to work with and very lightweight at first (I'm sure there are people out there who have no idea that the internet used to sound like... wait, the probably don't know much about FAX machines either...) due to "broadband" not even being a consumer concept at that point in time. Since then JavaScript (ECMAScript) has evolved into quite a little powerhouse of a language, that still remains quite accessible (realistically, a browser and a text editor can get someone started with the webstack, and while some languages are capable of similar, most will not offer the "GUI" type approach than many people these days are more comfortable with), and yet highly extensible to target different niche environments. Realistically, the hop onto the desktop environment is relatively new (the Atom editor (and its various forks) being some of the more polished offereings), but it does not seem to have any major obstacles in its way to allowing fast and easy deployment of robust and usable cross-platform applications. Yes, the applications have to include a minimal executable browser, so this might not be the ideal solution for an embedded application, or in situations where storage space is at a premium, but for the average computer user, the space will not be an issue.</p>

<p>--The other topic I wanted to mention was a Linux distribution that I found the other day. It is called GeckoLinux (<a href="https://geckolinux.github.io/">https://geckolinux.github.io/</a>), and it is a spin of OpenSuSe (<a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">https://www.opensuse.org/</a>) that aims to be a bit more desktop friendly, instead of being targeted towards server use. It also includes the Cinnamon desktop environment (one of my favorites), and a few other nice touches to make OpenSuSe feel a bit more polished. I haven't made the full jump from Ubuntu yet, but I must admit that it is getting a good amount of daily use as I work towards seeing if I can get it setup just right (no, my Ubuntu setup is not "perfect" but it has been the best compromise so far).</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot to mention... Playing around with JavaScript, and looking around at "alternatives (I already knew about ClojureScript), I have stumbled across a very strong platform to start trying out polyglot programming as well (even stronger than Java from what I can tell), but I'm going to call it for now, and start working more on that post (;</p>
