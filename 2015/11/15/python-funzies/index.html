            <p>Growing up, I had atrocious handwriting, so because of this, I quickly graduated and adopted to typing things out instead of handwriting them. As a result of this, my handwriting never really improved.</p>

<p>A friend on my e-cig chatroom pointed me towards trying to handwrite with fountain pens. On a whim, I picked up a "Preppy" by the company "Platinum" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Platinum-Fountain-Preppy-Black-PPQ-200-/dp/B001H0CEM4%3Fpsc%3D1%26SubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduckduckgo-d-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001H0CEM4">http://www.amazon.com/Platinum-Fountain-Preppy-Black-PPQ-200-/dp/B001H0CEM4%3Fpsc%3D1%26SubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduckduckgo-d-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001H0CEM4</a>), They also have a "medium" nib, but I had read that a finer nib helps with messy handwriting. I did my best to work it into my daily writing, and to write more.</p>

<p>Not only did my handwriting improve, I discovered a joy in writing with a pen that takes some skill to use, I quickly graduated to higher end pens, and discovered Goulet Pen Company. I've purchased a couple of Ahabs (<a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/noodler-s-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-cardinal-darkness-red-w-black-/p/N15029-R">http://www.gouletpens.com/noodler-s-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-cardinal-darkness-red-w-black-/p/N15029-R</a>) and a Joy (<a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/lamy-joy-calligraphy-fountain-pen-black-1.5mm-stub/p/LMY-L15-15">http://www.gouletpens.com/lamy-joy-calligraphy-fountain-pen-black-1.5mm-stub/p/LMY-L15-15</a>) with a calligraphy nib. I've also purchased numerous inks for the Joy, and Ahab.</p>

<p>I have become quite fond of the Ahab, the slight flex to the nib, combined with a wonderful ink (like "Charles Dickens" by De Atramentis) just allows one to add such a personal touch to the written word, a bit of oneself in ordinary everyday communication. And actually sitting down and writing a letter to someone, hand addressing the envelope in a bit of a fancy script, really adds that personal and human touch back into a day to day that is so very digitally dominated.</p>

<p>Do I fear the fact that digital is taking over? Not at all, it is inevitable, convenient, easy, affordable. Everything that makes it "good" for us as consumers and end-users. At the same time, I will not give up on elegance and individuality in communication. Standards, formatting, and a lack of "personality" are often good things when it comes to writing "good" code, but it is not something we should ever lose sight of as humans and individuals.</p>

<p>I've also dove deeper into this world, having purchased several nibs and holders for dip pens, and purchased a book with several calligraphic scripts. While I truly never intend to use them to their perfect, measured use, I do like incorporating the ideas, general patterns, and stylistic touches into my own writing. The beauty of controlled ink, colours changing ever so slightly with the pressure applied to the nib, the gentle scratching noise of the nib along the paper. It is a surreal feeling.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest tossing a Preppy into your next purchase at Amazon. It is something you will probably never regret, and find far more enjoyment than the cost of the pen in rediscovering the true joy of the written word.</p>
