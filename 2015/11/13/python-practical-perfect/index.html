            <p>It is funny how we often have the most elegant solution to our problems right under our noses...</p>

<p>A little history blurb: Even after discontinuing my formal studies in Java and C++, I still dual-booted Windows and some form of Linux whenever I could, and often used Python under Linux instead of making bash scripts. I never got too deep into it though...</p>

<p>Fast-forward to when I'm starting back into programming. Python is mentioned, but part of me doesn't seem to be able to accept what Python is these days: A very well written language for quickly solving smaller problems. While this might seem to be a limitation, the real power shows with how easy it is to combine Python modules, <em>and</em> how easy it is to interface with C libraries in order to take it "closer to the metal" when needed (callling Rust libraries in Python isn't too shabby either!).</p>

<p>So it took me a little while to come back `round to Python again, but it really does feel good to be working in something that I have maintained a familiarity with, and can grasp at the concepts that allow me to implement things that are pushing towards my goals, instead of starting from the ground up and learning the basic syntax and semantics of a new language. Part of this realization occured when I was working through the tutorial for the roguelike game at roguebasin (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/Python-Roguelike">http://tinyurl.com/Python-Roguelike</a>). Putting together an entire game using Python really opened my eyes to how capable a language Python is.</p>

<p>Realistically, do I see Python as a "great" programming language for every situation? No, not at all, but for quick prototyping/development of (just about) anything? It is incredible. The power to tie into C libraries, and serve as glue code to get something done quickly is outstanding. If the software is more than just a one off quick-fix, optimizations can be done, re-written into full C if needed, etc. But sometimes, a slightly larger/slower program is an acceptable compromise for rapid development and deployment.</p>

<p>A quick note on Python 2 vs. Python 3. Python 2 is in "extended security support" status, and at this point, the only reason I'm still working with Python 2 is because Kivy is not 100% Python 3 yet, many other major libraries have been converted. It is not the easiest of transitions, due to semantic changes in the language. While this is unfortunate, it wasn't without long debate, with a lot of effort put forth into minimizing the problems created. Despite this, I do suggest learning 3, however, I do not suggest ignoring some of the better tutorials based on 2 that are out there. Especially for someone completely new to the language, the changes are not so drastic that a tutorial will be "broken" (yes, there will be syntax changes, and a few things might not work any more, but the meat of any good tutorial will still be completely useful Python). The Python community as a whole has been very helpful and supportive in efforts to make sure everyone can move to adopt the new standard as soon as possible. A few of my favourite tutorials are (in no particular order): <br>
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/</a> (is Python 2, but still really helps cement the basics). <br>
<a href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/">http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/</a> (a great, easy to read and digest tutorial). <br>
<a href="http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/">http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/</a> <br>
(fantastic and Python 3).
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/Python3-Wikibook">http://tinyurl.com/Python3-Wikibook</a> (a good introduction to Python 3).</p>

<p>Yes, I am definitely a Python fanboy at this point, I think that it is a language that anyone serious about using their computer will obtain at least a passing knowledge of due to how prevalent and useful it is. All major Linux distributions have Python installed by default, most have transitioned to 3 almost, if not, completely by now. It is a solid language, with a vast ecosystem of tools for everything ranging from scripting, to games (text, 2D, 3D), web frameworks, advanced numerical operations and processing, and more. With Python, if you can think up a task, there is a very good chance there is a module or project out there that can help you solve your problem quickly. A good starting point for someone who wants to see what Python can do for them can be found at: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc">https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc</a> It starts off with a short introduction to basic Python programming, and leads into useful applications of those concepts without going too deep into Python itself (bonus, it uses Python 3).</p>

<p>In Atom, the only special concession I make for Python is to show the indentations of my code as thin vertical lines to help me keep my code blocks separated. Python is one of the few syntaxes in coding that I can tolerate reading without highlighting, but there is no way I wouldn't be using it when writing my own code! The readability of Python is actually quite good as long as the coder takes time to follow the PEP8 guidelines (<a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a>). I found this article: <a href="http://opensource.com/business/15/10/jane-austen-on-python">http://opensource.com/business/15/10/jane-austen-on-python</a> quite interesting regarding the readability of Python code.</p>

<p>All in all, rediscovering Python, digging into Rust, and exploring Haskell (and all the other languages along the way (notably Scheme/LISP variants)) have taught me a lot about readability and expressiveness in computer programming languages, something I had never really considered back when learning Java and C++, truthfully it wasn't really touched on by my instructors. Readable code was code that used descriptive variable/function/method/class/etc. names, and was properly commented. Nothing more, it didn't matter how the code itself looked in the end, as long as you could explain it in comments. I always have commented my code, more so if it is not just for me. Although there are many cases where Python does not make it needed (print(), for i in range(10):, are just some examples of things that convey their intent well in Python) as much, and one can argue that annotated types in Haskell are a great start to comments for any function in any language! Rust too has a syntax that clearly conveys its intent (not that I wouldn't be adding comments as well, just that they will translate better from comment to code than in some other languages).</p>
