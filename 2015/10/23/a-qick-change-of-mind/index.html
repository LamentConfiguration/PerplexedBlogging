        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Welcome to my madness...</p>

<p>It was only yesterday (<a href="http://lamentconfiguration.github.io/PerplexedBlogging/2015/10/22/a-clarification-of-sorts/">http://lamentconfiguration.github.io/PerplexedBlogging/2015/10/22/a-clarification-of-sorts/</a>) that I was praising Racket as my Scheme of choice, and already I am going to change the context in which I recommend it.</p>

<p>As a language to learn, especially for someone new to programming. I honestly feel that Racket (<a href="http://racket-lang.org/">http://racket-lang.org/</a>) is incredibly hard to beat. It has a rare combination of ingredients, that combine to set up a newbie programmer for not only success, but fun!</p>

<p>The first thing that it has going for it is the fact that DrRacket is "batteries included" once you get it installed. It comes with a solid IDE, as well as a compiler, as well as libraries that are easy to integrate should one need them.</p>

<p>Secondly, with "How To Design Programs" (HTDP: <a href="http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-1.html">http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-1.html</a>) along with the companion (<a href="http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Companion/">http://htdp.org/2003-09-26/Companion/</a>), the language being used grows with your ability and learning. <br>
<em>Note: I know there is a second version of the book, but it isn't complete yet, and you can go through after and see what changes/updates have happened if you really want to stick with Racket.</em></p>

<p>Now, as to why I'm changing how I feel about it, I wanted to follow a Scheme with an interpreter/compiler that was (or is) going to continue following the Scheme standards. AFAIK Racket does not plan on following R7RS (the current "standard" for Scheme), but is forging its own path (again, there is <strong>nothing</strong> wrong with this, it just doesn't fit my needs/wants in a Scheme).</p>

<p>So, to reiterate in closing: I still have a LOT of respect and fond feelings for Racket, I just do not see a point in following a language that doesn't give me what I want from it. Scheme being a minimalist language (at heart), is something that I would like to see more of, at least as an option. R6RS is already a very full-featured Scheme, and I agree with the "Steering Committee" that there should be a minimalist version of R7RS as well as a more feature heavy one, but standardized to "be a Scheme" (yes, if this sounds like nit-picking, it is).</p>

<p>--The Perplexed One</p>

<p>(note: currently seeking Scheme)</p>
