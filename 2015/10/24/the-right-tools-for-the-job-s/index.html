            <p>--I am not a fan of big, heavy IDEs. There, I said it. More than not being a fan, I truly detest these tools for how much of the process of making code gets hidden, buried deep within some helper plugin or whatnot. Do they have a purpose? Yes, of course, but I feel that too many get pushed into using/relying on them too early in their time spent coding.</p>

<p>Let me clarify a bit... <br>
Do I feel that every single one of the tools presented by a Heavyweight IDE (H-IDE) is useful? Yes, they all have their place. Do I think that someone learning <em>any</em> language should jump right in (by choice or by requirement for ciriculum) to something like Eclipse or Visual Studio? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>I am not saying that everyone should start completely in a command line / non-mouse text editor for "Hello World!" but I am saying that learning the little things (like a REPL or compiler) from the beginning, help to create a more solid connection to the language.</p>

<p>However, there are a few editor features which really do help when starting off. The most important is a configurable indent, most languages have a standard number of "spaces" to indent (and often must be done with "space" characters and not "tab" characters) in order to compile/run correctly. Everything else truly is optional beyond this point in an editor. As long as you can set what the tab key does explicitly, you have the minimum. Auto-indenting also helps remove a lot of "busy-keystrokes" when coding.</p>

<p>Another simple, but powerful tool is good syntax highlighting (in a theme that helps <em>you</em> distinguish elements and is easy to read for extended periods of time). Syntax highlighting helps to give some "meat" to the "bones" of the code (the words), and can even help spot errors (print() (the function) will show up differently than print (the symbol/class/etc.) with good syntax highlighting) that could otherwise be very easy to glance over when reading through code. Realistically, I am probably over-dependent on good syntax highlighting to be productive.</p>

<p>Finally, the only truly "optional" tool that I really can't do without is good console integration. Again, this really isn't a mandatory thing to make writing code pleasant, but it kicks in when you start developing a program. This integration is not very useful though if the editor is rendered useless while anything is "active" in the console. Realistically this shines a lot more when the language has an interactive REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop - basically an interactive playground for code bits) than with a language that must be compiled completely first.</p>

<p>For a beginner, everything else just gets in the way of learning what is going on "behind the scenes" with the code, learning how to interpret oft-cryptic error messages earlier will come in handy when you manage to create one that the fancy debugger chokes on. Or getting used to compiler nuances can help when you have to start optimizing the code at the compile level.</p>

<p>When you get the point where you are working on huge projects, with many contributors and files, that is truly where the giant H-IDEs shine, especially if the code is not able to be created in a way that is modular enough that someone can work on a chunk independently of the rest of the code (nested dependency hell what?)</p>

<p>Realistically, there should be no reason that it takes longer to setup the H-IDE than to write "Hello World!" Sure, you will be using the same steps on everything from that tiny 1-liner up to huge files, and you will be saving time with the huge projects, but... still, it is letting the H-IDE do too much of the "basics" without explaining what is going on or why. There is no doubt that learning to make a proper project structure is very important, but it can be introduced gradually, in a way that doesn't require the IDE to do all the work. Learn why the IDE does things the way it does, so if you need to change something, you have an idea of where to start. Every tool has it's place, but writing "Hello World!" in a H-IDE is like using a chainsaw to whittle a stick...</p>

<p>Yes, I am old-school when it comes to this idea. I must admit I feel very "relaxed" when coding in an editor with a few "goodies" to help smooth out the workflow. Whereas the last two times I tried to get one of the H-IDEs going, I spent more time trying to make sure all of the plugins were configured correctly and "talking" properly to each other in order to avoid having warnings about things I was not even intending on using for a simple beginner's introduction to the language.</p>

<p>With that being said, I hope to see you all tomorrow when I (finally) discuss the language I've chosen to really focus on, although there have been some clues along the way, and maybe some of you have guessed it by now! <br>
(oh, and don't worry, I'll throw some gasoline on the Holy Fire that is emacs vs. vim in a later post...)</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br>
--The Perplexed One</p>
