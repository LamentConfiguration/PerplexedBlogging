            <p>--Again, welcome to my madness...</p>

<p>It has been a busy few days for me, and I haven't had much time to focus on coding , but that hasn't stopped my quest for knowledge!</p>

<p>Since I'm not involved in any kind of coding at my "job," I tend to spend a lot of time researching  programming, and programming concepts. I have several interests, all (mostly) converging towards a long-term goal. I also have some ideas and ideals for how to approach these goals, and would like to understand and implement them as early on in my coding "re initiation" as possible.</p>

<p>I understand that was quite vague, bear with me, I am still putting everything together myself. Needless(?) to say, I have changed the major "base" language I want to pursue due to how different languages handle concurrency (a topic I will touch on more in the future). The short version is that while a LISP <em>can</em> be utilized for concurrency, it doesn't inherently "understand" it. That is to say that the language supports it, but it has to be "baby-sat" and monitored in order to implement it properly (aka: safely).</p>

<p>This is not a "strike" against LISP in general, it is a result of when LISP was created. Lets remember that LISP was created when processors had only one core, that did not run very fast (by today's standards), and didn't have lots of memory to work with. Multiple/virtual cores, giga/terabytes, and distributed computing were computer-science dreams, possibly being worked on, and theorized about, but not implemented or seen as something that "needed to be handled" by a programming language. Although LISPs are able to adapt and utilize the current methods of implementing concurrency in languages that were not originally designed for it, they aren't "designed" to write programs that are inherently safe running in a concurrent environment.</p>

<p>A tangent to this... <br>
I enjoy having choices in a language (mutable/immutable data, functional/imperative paradigms, lazy or strict evaluation), but I also like having the defaults be accommodating to my preferences in program structuring, as well as to the general approach I want to take with software development for the future. I would rather have the "safer" way be the "idiomatic" and built-in paradigm, and have to force the "unsafe" way explicitly when needed.</p>

<p>That being said, I want to hold off on posting about my "new" choice in languages (both until I can solidify a few things, as well as write a proper post and writeup) for a little bit. I want to emphasize that this is not a snub at Clojure in any way. It is a beautiful language, and I see it having a great future as a way to utilize the JVM with a language that is both easy to use, and very powerful. It (and LISPs in general) just aren't the "closest" to what I consider the "best fit" for my long term goals in coding.</p>

<p>--More "normal" coding stuff.
I am about one-thousand lines in on the tutorial for making that roguelike (<a href="http://goo.gl/7ujtoz">http://goo.gl/7ujtoz</a>), and have gotten through section ten. I still intend on porting this tutorial to Hy, and then possibly to the new "language of choice," as I feel it is a great tutorial, as it lets one create something "usable" as well as also presenting good coding practices (building from the bottom up, modularity and code re-use, proper commenting). The tricky part will be duplicating the library (libtcod: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod">https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod</a>) for the new platform.</p>

<p>I have also found a new editor that has really caught my eye, as it aims to combine two of my favorite tools (VIM and EMACS), into one super-deluxe-editor-of-awesomeness. It is called Spacemacs (<a href="https://github.com/ajnsit/spacemacs">https://github.com/ajnsit/spacemacs</a>).</p>

<p>Like I mentioned at the start of this post, I have been quite busy, but I hope to finish up that roguelike tutorial, and get a couple of solid posts out this week. I'm currently planning one on editors, one on concurrency, and another on the new language. I'll probably toss in one that is a bit off-topic (for the blog) as well (just to keep things interesting).</p>
