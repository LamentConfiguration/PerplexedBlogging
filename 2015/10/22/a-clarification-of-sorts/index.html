        <section class="post-content">
            <p>In my last post, I stated that I didn't choose several languages to be the one that I focused on in my journey back into coding. While on the surface this is true, I must admit I have a hard time just "settling" on one language (or another (I have a similar problem with Linux distros, but that is a whole `nother story!)). There are so many fascinating nuances that different languages have, it is impossible for me to not pay at least some attention to other languages.</p>

<p>On that note, I would like to present the languages that I am going to be dabbling in, but not focusing on, and why I am interested in them (also, I am not happy with my "chosen language" post yet, but this one came out ok (it was originally intended to follow the "chosen one" post)).</p>

<p>First up is Python (<a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>), while it isn't ideal for my long-term goals, I still enjoy it a lot and it has a lot going for it in terms of community and continued evolution. <em>However</em> I will not be focusing on Python in its standard form, instead I will be using "Hy" to work with Python for the most part. Hy (<a href="http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/index.html">http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/index.html</a>) is a LISP that generates a Python AST, and is fully compatible with Python (Yes, I'm a LISPaddict... just not a SmugLispWeenie (<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SmugLispWeenie_">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SmugLispWeenie_</a>)).</p>

<p>Next, is a language that I didn't mention in the previous post: TCL. TCL (<a href="http://tcl.tk/">http://tcl.tk/</a>) is a small, light LISP-like (yep, again!) language, that is very cross-platform in the desktop arena, and great for lightweight GUI applications, and has the benefit of being LISP-like without a "variant" (like Python/Hy).</p>

<p>Alas, what good is a LISPaddict if they don't work with an "actual" LISP. While I truly do not have much (if any) interest in the "Common LISP" ecosystem, a small LISP named "Pixie" has caught my eye, and I'm following the project (<a href="https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie">https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie</a>) because it seems to be a very "modernized" approach to a LISP-esq language.</p>

<p>I did mention Racket in the previous post. Racket (<a href="http://racket-lang.org/">http://racket-lang.org/</a>) is a solid Scheme (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/9x9qkod">http://tinyurl.com/9x9qkod</a> (wikipedia)) implementation, and the IDE (DrRacket) has a lot of compatibility options for various Scheme standards. One of my favorite tutorials (How To Design Programs - HTDP) is written to take advantage of Racket's ability to "create" programming languages, to ease the introduction without forcing one to create "wimpy" or "useless" programs just to learn a language. For someone wanting to learn about making a program (vs. just coding one) it is my favorite recommendation. The website: <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">http://www.schemers.org/</a> has many other implementations listed as well.</p>

<p>I also touched on "D" (<a href="http://dlang.org/">http://dlang.org/</a>). D claims (and feels to me) to be what C++ should be. It has seamless interop with C, and can be very low-level when needed, but has a very elegant high-level syntax for general use (it can even be used as a scripting language!). It strives to cherry-pick many of the best attributes of different programming paradigms (procedural, functional, and object-oriented), and let the coder flow between them at will.</p>

<p>As for the other mentioned languages (Haskell (<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">https://www.haskell.org/</a>), OCaml (<a href="http://ocaml.org/">http://ocaml.org/</a>), Ruby (<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">https://www.ruby-lang.org/</a>), Common Lisp (<a href="https://common-lisp.net/">https://common-lisp.net/</a>), and Perl(<a href="https://www.perl.org/">https://www.perl.org/</a>) (you can tell I'm a LISP-er because I'm ok nesting parenthesis!)), I will not be following these languages more than tangentially, just due to the limits of my brain, and time. This is not to say that they are inferior to what I have chosen (in many ways, they can be seen as superior), just that I do not feel that they "fit" me quite as well.</p>

<p>Well, now with that all out of the way, I better get working on what you have all been (patiently? I hope so!) waiting for: The language I've actually chosen!</p>

<p>Hope to be parsed by you again soon!</p>
