            <p>--Firstly, I change my editor syntax theme colors... frequently. </p>

<p>--Secondly, I know (too?) many different "approaches" to solving the Rubik's cube (there are a lot more than most would think!), and change them out (also somewhat frequently), depending on my mood towards cubing at the time. Yes, I also own variants besides the "normal" 3x3x3 cube (I have NxNxN for 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 6, as well as some non-cube variants, or cubes with strange "cuts" and axis...).</p>

<p>So about those syntax colors... <br>
When I was younger, I chose syntax highlighting themes that were noticeably different across languages. In retrospect this was not the best use of that capability. I still apply it somewhat today, but I've broken it up a bit more. I look at syntax "themes" and "syntax highlight style" as different entities.</p>

<p>"Syntax themes"(ST) are the palate and tonality of the colors involved in the highlighting. While "syntax highlight style"(SHS) is <em>how</em> those colors are applied to the code. In general, I do tend to use a different ST for things like html and "code" and (sometimes) variations between programming languages. I do tend to keep to a darker background, with important things set to <strong><em>pop</em></strong> for the most part, and even higher contrasts for when I'm reading over or debugging. The concept of SHS is to vary the amount of elements utilizing those eye-catching colors at different stages with the same code. It is a different way of "folding" the code so you can focus on the details you are looking for.</p>

<p>Ahhh, and now onto another of my obsessions: Rubik's puzzles. Firstly, I must admit I have no "natural" ability with the cube-type puzzles, everything I know, I learned from various places on the internet. One thing that has always fascinated me is how everything about how the cube works, can be described in mathematical terms. The different solution styles all have different levels of "mathematical complexity" with the more complex ones often (theoretically) quicker, due to less turns being needed overall. On the one hand, you have an approach that requires you to learn two "series" (a "right" and "left" hand version of each, but they are mirrors of each other), this method is not a speed demon in any way, because for most of the solve you put 1 piece in place at a time (there is 1 group of 2, and one group of 3).</p>

<p>Most methods start with building the first two layers by placing one or two pieces at a time, but incorporate "series" that are much more specialized in the pieces they move and how they move them. These specialized series often affect both the location, and orientation of multiple pieces all at once. This efficiency comes at a price though, the solver must remember more information, and be able to quickly recognize the "patterns" that match up to the series. This isn't to say one can't get quite fast with the piece-by-piece method, not at all, over time one will start to recognize patterns and be able to "look ahead" of the solve. Finding their own patterns and "specialized series."</p>

<p>I for one go through phases in the kind of solution I prefer. I love the elegance of the "two series" solution, I like how I can really "see" what I am doing with each turn of a face (whereas with the specialized ones, I tend to see the beginning and the end, the intermediary steps are just "magic" (probably because the series are often computer generated for efficiency these days)). There is an elegance to solving the cube this way (although the "endgame" can get quite frustrating in a few cases), it is not something I try to be fast with, but it is more of a relaxation thing, but I also enjoy working with the "faster" methods just because I honestly think it is pretty neat to be able to quickly solve the cube. However, without regular practice, the more "advanced" series tend to quickly slip from my mind. I keep enough in my head to be able to stay under 2 minutes for a solve in general though.</p>

<p>That being said, for the most part, I stick to a method that quickly allows me to get to the "endgame" (most challenging) part of the "two series" method (using an "intuitive approach). Why? because it is the part I enjoy most, and requires the most "understanding" of how the cube works (until you start "creating" your own advanced series that is (which not many, if any do today, since it is a closed system, computers can generate series based on any constraints one could want, it is quite incredible really)). Finishing a solve this way feels the same to me as getting my code to run correctly.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the start of the "two series" solution: <br>
<a href="http://twistypuzzling.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-i-found-ultimate-solution.html">http://twistypuzzling.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-i-found-ultimate-solution.html</a></p>

<p>And here is a link to the wiki I have found all of the other methods I have experimented with: <br>
<a href="https://speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">https://speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a></p>

<p>If you are looking to just be able to solve it, and understand how it is working (and be able to still get decently quick). I suggest understanding the "two series", then looking into the "Petrus" method (more series heavy) and the "Heise" methods. The Heise method focuses more on using intuition, and "setting up" things, whereas the Petrus method is a bit more algorithm heavy (there are alternates to solving the last layer that use less algorithms (4LLL).</p>

<p>If you truly want to dive into the speedsolving side, I would start with the "two series" method, and then look into Petrus, "CFOP," and "Roux." They all have a different approach to solving the cube, and there can be some things that one method has that will help one understand what is going on in another. There is also EOLine/ZZ which is a very advanced method that requires a lot of memorization and ability to "look ahead" in the solve.</p>
