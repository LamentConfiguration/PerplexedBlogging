        <section class="post-content">
            <p>First, I'd like to discuss a few languages that I respect, but did not select to pursue as a primary "target" for learning. Knowing that there is truly no "one perfect language" (or implementation of a language in some cases), I did poke around a <strong>LOT</strong> looking for a language that suited <em>my</em> personal wants (needs?) in a language. Let me re-iterate, I fully respect and enjoy tinkering around with these languages, but at this point in time, I had to pick one to focus on, and these languages, while awesome in their own ways, were not the perfect fit for <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>At first, due to using it a lot for scripting, I thought Python would be a good choice. I still think Python is a great language, and easy to work with, but it felt too similar to Java and C++ in terms of syntax and structure to me, and this is something I wanted to avoid if possible.</p>

<p>I then started poking around Wikipedia and stumbled upon Haskell. Haskell, while a beautiful language (it reminds me of theoretical physics, a subject I enjoy greatly), suffers from a phenomenon known as "cabal hell" which can make library selection difficult, especially for someone just trying to get started coding things again. I love <em>what</em> Haskell is, just not the intricacies of building software with it.</p>

<p>Haskell turned me on to the concept of functional programming, and at that point I was hooked. I started looking into various Scheme dialects (Racket for the most part), OCaml, and LISPs. All of which I enjoyed using, but I was not personally happy with the libraries in general, or the lack of easy deployment to the mobile arena (I'm focusing on small apps for tasks, and want to be able to target the largest audiences possible, maybe not with every application, but without having to significantly change my toolchain or language used).</p>

<p>While poking around with those, I also stumbled upon "D" (DLang). DLang has a lot going for it in my mind, in terms of raw power and flexibility, and even felt somewhat comfortable to work in despite its similarities to C++, but again, it doesn't seem to (currently) have a toolchain to support mobile development directly. Which honestly doesn't surprise me, seeing as how it is intended to be used in the same places one would use C++. This will be a language I will be keeping an eye on for sure.</p>

<p>I also looked at Ruby and Perl, but they really felt like they filled the same niche in my toolkit as Python, without offering anything "more" in terms of deployable platforms, so I passed on them as well.</p>

<p>Now, having read through all of that, you are probably hoping to hear what I finally settled on to work with, but you will have to wait until the next post to find that out! (I have to keep people coming back somehow!)</p>

<p>See you on the flipped-bit side!</p>
