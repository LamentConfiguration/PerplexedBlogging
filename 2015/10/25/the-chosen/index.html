            <p>As promised...</p>

<p>I know, I haven't spent much time talking (directly) about the language I've chosen to pursue, mostly because I want to be able to sound as objective as possible in describing why I chose it...</p>

<p>... oh well, here goes!</p>

<p>I chose Clojure (<a href="http://clojure.org/">http://clojure.org/</a>)!</p>

<p>Why Clojure? Especially given my dislike for Java? Turns out there is a good reason!</p>

<p>The reason is: the JVM. Yes, not Java itself, but the VM it runs on. The incredible portability, coupled with the vast ecosystem of libraries available to languages that run on the JVM, made pursuing an "alternate" language to run on the JVM, a "good idea" (at least to me).</p>

<p>Why Clojure? Well, it is a LISP-inspired language, primarily functional in nature, with a syntax that makes me comfortable (yes, I <em>like</em> parenthesis!), and development tools that permit my preferred workflow when working on a program (the REPL and Leiningen (<a href="http://leiningen.org/">http://leiningen.org/</a>)  a build tool in Clojure, for Clojure).</p>

<p>There are several other JVM languages as well, but none of them strive to be a LISP, they all have a shift away from what Java is, in an attempt to address various issues, but Clojure is the one that addresses mine the best. Let me touch on why those didn't "make it" for me.</p>

<p>Ceylon (<a href="http://www.ceylon-lang.org/">http://www.ceylon-lang.org/</a>) is the language that frustrated me to no end trying to use Eclipse (a "Heavyweight IDE"), however, there are some neat things (union and intersection types, type inference) in Ceylon, so I'll be keeping my eye on it.</p>

<p>Groovy (<a href="http://www.groovy-lang.org/">http://www.groovy-lang.org/</a>) just doesn't feel very different from Java, it is a different approach (that some love), but, to me,it feels like a strange combination of the elements of Java and Python that I enjoy the least.</p>

<p>Scala (<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">http://www.scala-lang.org/</a>) actually tempted me and held my attention for a bit before I found Clojure. I like a <strong>lot</strong> about Scala. To me it feels like the D to Java's C++. Very refined, very powerful, but still imperative/object-oriented at it's heart. I also like it a lot because it seems as though interop between it and Clojure is relatively easy (I'm going to assume it isn't "perfect" <em>and</em> that it is also possible with Ceylon and Groovy, in case I find some really neat bits there).</p>

<p>Now Clojure: It is very hard to find anything I truly dislike about this language. Yes, the JVM does not start up quickly. I am not terribly worried about this right now due to the scope of what I plan on developing. The fact that the JVM is everywhere is far far more important to me.</p>

<p>Clojure also has a paradigm and syntax that I am comfortable with, an approach to creating code that feels natural. This has been quite obvious to me the past few days, as I've been working on something that isn't in a LISP-esq language.</p>

<p>I have been working a "Rougelike" game in Python, following this tutorial: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/o2325sc">http://tinyurl.com/o2325sc</a>. I have been doing this in order to actually attempt to create a version of the tutorial for Hy (a language that draws inspiration from Clojure, but is Python-compatible). I am doing this for several reasons: <br>
1) I needed a project that had more meat than the tutorials I was finding in general. <br>
2) Roguelikes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike</a>) are cool. <br>
3) I'd like to contribute something nice to the Hy community. <br>
4) It will give me practice to create it for Clojure (I will probably have to dissect and recreate the libtcodpy to some extent to move it to Clojure, and I'm not quite ready for that yet).</p>

<p>Coding and debugging Python has definitely gave me moments saying "Why isn't this abstracted to a function!?" (when writing boilerplate for the 10th time) or "If I only had some parenthesis to control nesting instead of just whitespace?" (when tracking down an annoying bug). I truly am a LISP-er at heart, and I truly thank the Clojure community for helping to support and grow such a wonderful language.</p>

<p>Functional programming and LISPs have opened my eyes to coding in a way they have never been open before. I <em>knew</em> what I was doing when I was learning C++ and Java, but I didn't <em>understand</em> or know <em>why</em> I was doing things. I could write out boilerplate code all day, but the way data and functions are treated in those languages doesn't "mesh" with how I tend to picture data flowing.</p>

<p>--Now, back to the focus of this post. A bonus of Clojure is that it has superb interop with Java when needed. There are a few things that Clojure either doesn't optimize well, or the coding is just awkward and inelegant (which is both no fun to work with, and against my vision of a Clojure program in the first place). In those cases, one can seamlessly implement Java techniques to handle it (and as mentioned above, it should be possible to use techniques from the other JVM languages as well).</p>

<p>Another bonus of Clojure is that it also has a compiler for JavaScript (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript</a>) allowing access to another widely-distributed platform, adding even more functionality and "value" to learning it (this is not unique to Clojure out of the JVM languages, but it is still pretty sweet regardless). There is even a compiler targeting the CLR (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/6q3ffm9">http://tinyurl.com/6q3ffm9</a>) to target Microsoft's .Net virtual machine.</p>

<p>All of this would be well and good for a sales pitch, but Clojure still has an ace up its sleeve. The community. There are a vast number of tutorials and community resources to help one "get" Clojure (I do crack myself up...). The #clojure chatroom on Freenode (<a href="https://freenode.net/">https://freenode.net/</a>) is absolutely one of the most helpful group of people I have ever had the pleasure of asking for help. Just remember, nobody is getting paid to be in there, if you don't get an answer right away, just be patient, or say you are leaving (if you have to go), and then come back later (announce your leaving so someone doesn't type out the answer only to have you not be there, some of us don't have show joins/parts on &gt;.&lt;).</p>

<p>Well, I think that's about it for this post. I know I've only touched on a few things, but I will now be able to start posting about "All things Clojure" (tips, tidbits, examples, rants, ponderings, etc.) here soon. (flip side. Catch you on the).</p>

<p>note: there is an update to this post here: (<a href="http://lamentconfiguration.github.io/PerplexedBlogging/2015/10/27/interesting-new-information/">http://lamentconfiguration.github.io/PerplexedBlogging/2015/10/27/interesting-new-information/</a>)</p>
