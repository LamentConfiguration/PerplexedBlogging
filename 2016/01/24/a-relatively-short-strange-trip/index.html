            <p>It has been quite some time since I've tormented you few readers...</p>

<p>I feel I have a lot to make up for in this regard. While I've been silent on the blogging front, the gears have been churning and grinding away.</p>

<p>Alas, I've not had much time to code, due to it being quite busy at my "real" job, the holidays, and catching quite a powerful flu bug.</p>

<p>However, none of this prevented me from googling and dabbling in things, and I've come around to a few realizations about myself as a coder, what I want to do coding, and more importantly, why I want to do these things.</p>

<p>I've realized that I'm one of those strange (few?) who actually prefer the way a lisp-esq language "works" (both syntactically and semantically), and I shouldn't worry too much about this due to the wonderful power of transpilers (a story for another time). The functional basis of a lisp just really works with how I envision code and how it "works" without forcing me to only use that paradigm when designing a program.</p>

<p>What I want to do in coding (long term at least) hasn't changed much, but I have redirected my short term goals a bit in order to get my feet wet with some real-world projects a bit quicker (hopefully).</p>

<p>Why I want to do it is not just "to do it" anymore, but "to do it <strong>my</strong> way." This isn't to say that I will not be using frameworks, libraries, etc. but that I'll be using things that "mesh" with how I approach a problem, instead of trying to teach my old brain new ways of thinking.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, I've set a new roadmap for myself (again!? yes... again!) and development.</p>

<p>My great and overbearing long-term focus will be on lisp-esq languages. I also want to "understand" Haskell, and FORTH.</p>

<p>Short-term I'm going to focus on Clojure and ClojureScript for "run anywhere" type programs (be it the web, or JVM), and digging deeper into lisp-esq languages, while having interop with a plethora of incredible libraries. When needed, I will use Go, and Python (3, not 2) to serve as glue in situations where spinning up a JVM for Clojure, or using Node.js with Clojurescript is not a good idea. This combination should allow me to cover all the bases when it comes to deploying any type of application that I can dream up.</p>

<p>Mid-term I'm going to focus on learning Scheme (probably R7RS) and Common Lisp (CCL or SBCL). I'm going to stick to just using them for "local" applications, data handling, etc. in order to familiarize myself with how they work, without having to really dig into making non-native libraries work. I also plan on familiarizing myself with ABCL and Kawa Scheme in order to bring the advantages of those lisp dialects to the JVM.</p>

<p>Long-term I truly hope to be able to find a way, or be a part of a renaissance for lisp. How this will come along, I have no idea. I just hope that it does, and I hope to be a part of it.</p>

<p>Regading Haskell. Someday I hope to be able to "understand" Haskell, but I really do not think that long-term it is the ideal language for me. I keep reminding myself of my own comparison of Haskell to Theoretical Physics: They are both fascinating things which I can appreciate, and comprehend when explained in layman's terms, but they are not something that I am inherently comfortable dabbling with and trying to develop on my own. Perhaps one day this will change, but I will not consider learning Haskell a "bust" if it does not. The mathematical elegance and beauty of the language is just something that truly fascinates me. Likewise, FORTH fascinates me, but more in how similar it is to Lisp, in that you build the language to fit your program, instead of making your program fit the constraints of the language.</p>
